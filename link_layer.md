# Elixxir mix network link layer protocol

## Abstract

This document describes the Elixxir link layer which is the
lowest level protocol in the Elixxir protocol stack and allows
the Elixxir network components to communicate to one another.

## Introduction

As mentioned in the [architectural overview](architecture.md) the
Elixxir mix network functions as an overlay network. This means that
Elixxir protocol layers are built on top of existing Internet
protocols. The Elixxir link layer is built on top of TCP/IPv4 (IPv6
is not disabled but also not tested at this time) and consists 
of TLS transporting gRPC payloads.

TLS X.509 certs are derived from the Network Definition File[^0] (NDF).
The NDF acts as a sort of DNS zone file for the entire network but
includes port numbers and cryptographic keying material necessary
for the xx protocol stack, like the consensus document (generated by the
Tor network's Directory Authority system) in Tor.

Currently, a permissioning server[^1], which will be replaced by 
blockchain consensus, generates and signs the NDF. The cMix nodes poll
the permissioning server for the "Full" NDF, which consists of all
network connectivity information. The cMix gateways poll their local 
cMix node for both a "Partial" and "Full" NDF. A Partial NDF does not
contain connectivity information for other nodes, and clients are able
to poll any cMix gateways for the Partial NDF.

Diagram: Permissioning (generates NDF) -> Nodes -> Gateways -> Clients
- Gateways don't talk to permissioning
- Clients don't talk to nodes or permissioning
Similar to how cacheing dns resolvers .... clients don't need to talk to permissioning server 

The NDF contains a list of "Nodes" (cMix nodes) and "Gateways" (cMix gateways) 
that detail the address and the PEM encoded TLS X.509 public keys for 
each entity. An example of this data structure from a Partial NDF is as follows: 

```json

Every connection made by our wire protocol is protected by TLS. All
public keys for TLS are in this (signed) NDF. To make a connection, 
the initator (Dialer) provides the TLS certificate and the connection string
("Address" field in NDF) and the TLS library uses this to check that 
the certificate matches. This is similar to certificate pinning, except 
certificates can change as hosts are added and removed on the network through 
the PKI (permissioning server, TBD consensus mechanism) via changes in the NDF. 
For more details about the public key infrastructure, see the [PKI section](pki.md).

## TLS Ciphersuite and Parameterizations

**FIXME**: Fix the code so that it specifies the precise TLS ciphersuite and any other
relavant parameters. Then specify the ciphersuite selection here in this document.

## A tour of our TLS usage and it's CA controls.

The Elixxir mix network's TLS endpoints are controlled by NDF
(network definition file) which is distributed
by the mixnet PKI system. Embedded within the NDF are the x.509
Certificates for the TLS endpoints. These TLS certificates are
used to ensure that only authorized gateways and nodes may participate
in the mix network. However this TLS authentication is also used to
enforce the ordering of each mix cascade. As mentioned in the
architectural overview, the Elixxir mixnet is composed of many
cascades.


## gRPC protocol messages used by each network component

FIXME.

## Security Consideration

- Assuming the mixnet PKI works properly the link layer encryption should
  make Compulsion Attacks even more difficult. See the threat model section
  for further discussion about Compulsion Attacks.
